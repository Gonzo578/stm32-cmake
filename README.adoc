# CMake Build System for STM32 Microcontrollers

## Using the Docker Toolchain to Build your SW

In order to build your sowtware using docker, move to your project root directory and start the docker container as follows:

 docker run -it -v $(pwd):$(pwd) gonzo578/gcc-arm-embedded-2019q3:V0.0.1 /bin/bash

This starts a docker contrainer including the gcc-arm-embeedded-2019q3 toolchain. The projects root
directory is mapped to the same directory inside the container. This is required because currently the
pathes inside of the build results are absolute. In order to debug the application outside of the
container, the pathes need to be the same (else, the debugger would not find the source files). The other
solution can be to manually configure the source file locations for the debugger.

## Running your Build

In order to build the software inside the container conduct the following steps:

* Change to the project root folder (same as outside of the container)
* Create a build folder (´mkdir build´) => use out of source builds!
* Change to the build folder (´cd build´)
* run the following command

 cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/toolchain.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..

This runs cmake with the proper CMake toolchain file (location: ´/cmake/toolchain.cmake´) and with
build type ´debug´ in order to include debugging outputs in the build results.
