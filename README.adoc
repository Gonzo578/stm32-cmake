# CMake Build System for STM32 Microcontrollers

This project has the goal to build up a toolchain to build software for STM32 microcontrollers
running under Linux (Ubuntu18.04 in my case) using the CMake build system generator and docker.

Goals:

* Encapsulate the build toolchain (compiler, cmake, ...) within a docker container https://github.com/Gonzo578/docker-toolchain [toolchain]
* Create the build system by using CMake

Step by step integrate further tools

* Support unit testing by using gtest (on host system) with a separate docker container including the host toolchain
* Package management using conan (https://conan.io/)
* Code documentation using doxygen (http://www.doxygen.nl/)
* Developer documentation
* Code style checks clang-format (https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html)
* Static code analysis clang-tidy (https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/)

## Using the Docker Toolchain to Build your SW

In order to build your sowtware using docker, move to your project root directory and start the docker container as follows:

 docker run -it -v $(pwd):$(pwd) gonzo578/gcc-arm-embedded-2019q3:V0.0.1 /bin/bash

This starts a docker contrainer including the gcc-arm-embeedded-2019q3 toolchain. The projects root
directory is mapped to the same directory inside the container. This is required because currently the
pathes inside of the build results are absolute. In order to debug the application outside of the
container, the pathes need to be the same (else, the debugger would not find the source files). The other
solution can be to manually configure the source file locations for the debugger.
For convenience a script is provided with the project to start the docker container:

 ./run-docker.sh 

## Running your Build

In order to build the software inside the container conduct the following steps:

* Change to the project root folder (same as outside of the container)
* Create a build folder (´mkdir build´) => use out of source builds!
* Change to the build folder (´cd build´)
* run the following command

 cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/toolchain.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..

This runs cmake with the proper CMake toolchain file (location: ´/cmake/toolchain.cmake´) and with
build type ´debug´ in order to include debugging outputs in the build results. 

## Test Environment

The toolchain has been checked by using a STM3F4Disco board. (https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f4discovery.html).
Debugging is done with the STM32 System Workbench (https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/sw4stm32.html)
